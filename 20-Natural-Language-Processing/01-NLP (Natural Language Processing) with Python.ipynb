    "After counting the number of occurrences, the token 'weighting' and 'normalization' can be done with [TF-IDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf), using scikit-learn's `TfidfTransformer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "____\n",
    "### So what is TF-IDF?\n",
    "TF-IDF stands for *Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency*, and the TF-IDF 'weight' is a penalty often used in information retrieval and text mining. \n",
    "\n",
    "This 'weight' is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, but it is offset by the frequency of the word in the entire corpus. Variations of TF-IDF weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest *ranking functions* is computed by summing the TF-IDF for each query term - many more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this simple model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the TF-IDF weight is composed by two terms: \n",
    "* the first term computes the *normalized Term Frequency* (TF), aka the number of times a word appears in a document, divided by the total number of words in that document; \n",
    "* the second term is the *Inverse Document Frequency* (IDF), computed as the logarithm of the number of the documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents where the specific term appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF: Term Frequency** measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear many more times in longer documents than shorter ones. Thus, TF is often divided by the document length (aka the total number of terms in the document), as a way of normalization: \n",
    "\n",
    "*TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document).*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**IDF: Inverse Document Frequency** measures how important a term is. While computing TF, all terms are considered equally important. However it is known that certain terms, such as \"is\", \"of\", and \"that\", may appear a lot of times but have little importance. Thus we need to 'weigh' down the frequent terms while scale up the rare ones, by computing the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "*IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents with term t in it).*\n",
    "\n",
    "See below for a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a document containing 100 words where the word 'cat' appears 3 times. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *Term Frequency* (TF) for 'cat' is (3 / 100) = 0.03. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we have 10 million documents in total, and the word 'cat' appears in one thousand of these. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *Inverse Document Frequency* (IDF) is calculated as log(10,000,000 / 1,000) = 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the TF-IDF weight for the word 'cat' is the product of these quantities: 0.03 * 4 = **0.12**.\n",
